# SeleniumWithCucumberBasics
Basic attempt to use Selenium with cucumber

Cucumber:
Cucumber is a software tool used by computer programmers for testing other software. It runs automated acceptance tests written in a behavior-driven development style.


Selenium:
Selenium is a portable software-testing framework for web applications. Selenium provides a playback tool for authoring tests without the need to learn a test scripting language. But this project has been implemented as Selenium in Java.

I have tried:
Simple single features,
Multiple single features,
Features using the 'Examples',
Multiple scenario in single feature file.
